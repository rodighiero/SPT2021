# SPT2021

The Lexical Cartography is a visual method to map conference speakers. In a moment in which events went online, new instruments for orientation are needed.

The Cartography of SPT2021 showcasesÂ 400 speakers clustered according to their vocabulary. From the distant view, elevations and wordclouds show the most interesting areas to zoom in; from the close view, authors are arranged side by side and their proximity is explicitated by the most relevant keywords they share.

The map is built using vector reduction with TF-IDF, and delivered through Webpack and Pixi.js.
